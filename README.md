# Ad_Expenditure_Analysis
This project delves into analyzing and predicting sales based on advertising expenditures across multiple media channels. Using a dataset that captures spending on TV, radio, and newspaper advertisements alongside the resulting sales figures, the goal is to understand how investments in each channel influence sales and develop predictive models.
